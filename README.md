## Description
ShowThatRecipe is a mod that simply allows you to click a good to show it on a recipe popup
### Currently implemented
* Building construction materials
* Gathering huts
* Farms
* Hearth fuel slots
* Mine
* Geyser pump
* Rain collector
* Storage (only while in list mode)
* Resource deposits
### TODO
* Woodcutter -> this is probably just an internal storage.
* Static GoodSetSlot - a single good (with amount) you see on glade events. Surprisingly tough to add a button to.
* Dynamic GoodSetSlot - multiple ingredients you can choose from a radial menu. The middle of it is doable for sure, goods in a circle are a little tricky.
* Resource monitor at the top
